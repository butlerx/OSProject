Our program implements a bounded buffer than takes in ten seconds of audio data. It has two methods that affect the buffer contents, insertChunk and removeChunk.
These methods are syncronized so that they cannot affect the buffer at the same time. (mutual exclusion)

There is a producer class which reads audio data from the file and writes to the buffer as long as there is data available to write.
There is a consumer class which reads from the buffer and writes to the audio device as long as none of the flags are set which prevent this.
There are tests for different keyboard keys which will affect playback depending on what is pressed.
Upon closing each thread outputs to the terminal that it is shutting down.
