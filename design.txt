insertChunk
  This takes in a arguement of type byte[]. If roomavailable is False the method will wait until roomAvailable is True. it inserts the byte[] into audioChunk at
the posision of nextIn. nextIn is then incremented by 1 unless nextIn is the same as size then it will set it to zero. since audio has been entered dataAvailable
is set to True. If occupied is the same as size roomAvailble is set back to False.

removeChunk
  First checks if there is dataAvailable to remove if false it waits. temp is set to the next chunk to be read. nextOut is incremented by 1 and % by size.
room Availablt is set back to true. occupied is decremented  and if it equals 0 dataAvailable is set to false. all threads are notified and temp is returned,

  killed.

consumer - run
  while the buffer.finished is false byte is removed from the buffer and written to the audio stream.
